# LOQIO

*Etymology check: Loqio comes from Latin loqui ("to speak"). It's a witty word play for which I have no credit for (thanks ChatGPT.)*

**Loqio** is a comprehensive AI-powered language learning platform built with a microservice architecture. It features personalized learning paths tailored to individual progress, an integrated AI assistant for real-time guidance, and gamification elements to make language acquisition engaging and effective.

This full-stack web application serves as an educational project exploring modern software technologies, from backend microservices and databases to cloud deployment and DevOps practices.

## Running the Microservices

To run all microservices simultaneously during development:

```bash
.\gradlew --parallel :hello-world-service:bootRun :language-content-service:bootRun
```

This will start:
- **Hello World Service** on http://localhost:8081/
- **Language Content Service** on http://localhost:8082/

To run individual services:
- Hello World: `.\gradlew :hello-world-service:bootRun`
- Language Content: `.\gradlew :language-content-service:bootRun`
